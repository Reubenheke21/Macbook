        <p id="para1">Hey there! As you already know I'm Englesh, I prefer to be called Reuben. I am currently a home lending specialist
        at CBA at the moment however I wanted to dive into the world of Software Development. I come from this beautiful place across the ditch called New Zealand
        and as much as I miss home I wouldnt change it for the world.
