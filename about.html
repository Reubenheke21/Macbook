        <p id="para1">I am a home lending specialist working at CBA wanting to break into the tech world. I started my first coding experience in 2018 and have not been able to stop myself from 
            dabbling until I became serious and joined Coder Academy.</p>
        <p>Since beginning my journey I've created 3 websites, one was a gaming website called "Now Loading" where I used to write and create content based on the news coming 
            out about up and coming games. Once I was comfortable with that I began creating shopify websites mostly for myself so I could learn about passive income and also further develop 
            my skills because of COVID lots of people were using shopify to create their own stores and I wanted to learn.</p>
        <p>I was mostly self taught, finding anyway I could to learn different ways to code, I used Harvards CS50 course as well to attend lectures, then kept up with Codecademy. Now I am here, eager to learn and ready to put the skills I have learned to the test</p>
        <p>I am a very vanilla developer, like most I enjoy gaming. My favorite game at the moment is Destiny 2 since the new DLC came out I have been obsessed with playing it. Apart from that I enjoy spending time with my partner and my dog Leo.</p>
        <p>I am so obsesssed with problem solving, or learning how things work, I know we live in a world where everything changes so I welcome the challenge of not knowing everything but knowing that I will never run out of things to learn</p>
